        "13": "Most days were difficult and filled with tears as they listened to chilling testimony recounting the last few minutes of Ortiz's life and saw, for the first time, the crime scene and autopsy photos.",
        "14": "\"I think, for all of us, it was kind of reliving the nightmare all over, \" Chela Ortiz said.",
        "15": "Family members listened to testimony that included the defendant's violent past and the many times he escaped prosecution by using his gang's influence and power to intimidate victims - including two nearly killed when they were shot and stabbed in the back by Orozco, according to prosecutors.",
        "16": "Orozco's friends and fellow gang members also recalled his boasting about killing a cop one day.",

        "23": "None of them wanted to be identified because of the gang ties to the case.",
        "24": "The physical evidence, which including Orozco's DNA and fingerprints found on the murder weapon, was overwhelming, they said.",
        "25": "There were also a number of eye witnesses including two girls who described for the jury how Orozco hid behind their front door and shot the deputy as Ortiz spoke with their mother.",
        "26": "Equally as damning, jurors said, was the complete lack of remorse shown by the defendant.",
        "27": "He squandered two opportunities to turn his life around, including chances to relocate out of state and away from the gang with his family in Las Vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in Florida, they said.",
        "28": "It looked to them as though he preferred the life of a criminal and reveled in the notoriety he earned in the deputy's death.",
        "29": "A taped conversation between Orozco and two friends - one a fellow gang member and the other an associate - in a holding cell at the Bellflower Courthouse made it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish his threat to society, they said.",
        "30": "In that tape, Orozco is heard talking about destroying evidence and ordering a hit on the two little girls and their mother - the star witnesses in the case.",
        "31": "\"I had to hear that tape again, \" one juror said.",
        "32": "\"Because if we were going to send him to jail for life, he could run the same business from behind bars, \" a second juror added.",

        "37": "The 15 - year veteran, who learned the day before that he had made the rank of detective, was patrolling in Hawaiian Gardens near 223rd Street when he spotted Orozco and tried to stop him.",
        "38": "The gang member took off running with Ortiz behind him, according to court testimony.",
        "39": "Ortiz followed Orozco to an apartment complex in the 12500 block of East 223rd Street, to the home of one of Orozco's friends whom the deputy knew from previous altercations, at about 3: 30 p. m.",
        "40": "What Ortiz didn't know was that Orozco was lurking behind the woman's front door.",
        "41": "As Ortiz spoke to her and reholstered his weapon, Orozco steadied his hand while two of the woman's children - girls age 6 and 8 - and several of her friends looked on.",

        "44": "Tactical decision",
        "45": "Stan Perlo, one of two court - appointed defense attorneys assigned to Orozco, said the defendant's lack of support from his family dealt a massive blow to their case.",
        "46": "Originally, Orozco's mother was to take the stand to tell her son's story and talk about the many problems he faced growing up, Perlo said.",
        "47": "But she became nervous, telling her son the night before she was to testify that she did not want to go through with it, Perlo explained.",
        "48": "Orozco agreed not to force his mother to have to take the witness stand, a decision that likely destroyed his chance at any mercy on the part of the jury, he said.",
        "49": "\"Our problem was we had no one to tell his story, \" Perlo said.",
        "50": "\"We were counting on his mom and. .. she was too nervous to testify. \"",
        "51": "Perlo and co - counsel Robin Yanes approached Orozco's case from a somewhat unorthodox position.",
        "52": "Rather than argue their client's innocence, they repeatedly referred to their client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focused on a number of other people they claimed were equally responsible in the crime.",
        "53": "It was a tactical decision reached by the two veteran attorneys, both with extensive experience with death penalty cases, and after consultation with their peers, Perlo explained.",
        "54": "\"We made a lot of decisions that some lawyers would disagree with, \" he said.",
        "55": "\"I would add, personally, a lot of lawyers with a lot less experience. \"",
        "56": "Long process",
        "57": "When Orozco returns to court on May 3, Perlo and Yanes will argue for a mistrial and, if that is rejected, will ask Judge Philip Hickok to modify the jury's verdict and consider life without parole.",
        "58": "The chance either argument will be successful is slight, Perlo said.",
        "59": "But that then sets into motion the automatic appeals process, something that will be handled by a different set of attorneys.",
        "60": "During that time, Orozco will not be housed with the general population, he will have a cell all his own giving him isolation from much of the gang violence in the state's prisons.",
        "61": "At the very least, Perlo estimated the appeals process will last five years.",
        "62": "It could run into 20 years because there are both state and federal requirements that must be met, he added.",
        "63": "A large part of the problem stems from finding lawyers who are available for such a lengthy commitment of time, who are willing to take on a stressful job and who are qualified, Perlo said.",
        "64": "\"The decision today made the family happy, but unfortunately it's a false happiness, \" Perlo said after court Tuesday.",
        "65": "\"I've dealt with issues of death for many years. ..",
        "66": "the death penalty rarely offers. .. closure. \"",
        "67": "The Ortiz family, however, disagreed.",

        "69": "\"I'm happy with the verdict, we just have to wait it out now. \"",
        "70": "Prior to the reading of the verdict, the deputy's family and friends waited in a courtroom filled to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeaks of the attorneys' leather chairs.",
        "71": "Some bowed their heads and rubbed their faces, while others clasped their hands as though in prayer.",
        "72": "When the sentence was finally announced a collective gasp for air was followed by cries and sobs as relatives sitting behind the family leaned forward to rub their shoulders and give a comforting squeeze.",
        "73": "Outside the courtroom, Rosa Ortiz took out a button with a laminated picture of her slain son in uniform and handed it to the eldest of her five children, Art Ortiz, so that he could pin it on her blouse.",
        "74": "Once it was secure she kissed it tenderly.",
        "75": "For many minutes afterward, relatives and friends stood outside the courtroom hugging and crying.",
        "76": "Detective Dawn Retzlaff, one of the two lead homicide detectives on the case, said authorities were grateful for the jury's thorough and careful review of the facts and investigators were happy with the verdict, calling it just.",
        "77": "Speaking on behalf of the Sheriff's Department, Retzlaff added that they wanted to express their condolences to Ortiz's family in what was a devastating time.",
        "78": "\"It's not a happy day for anybody, \" said Deputy District Attorney Lowell Anger, who prosecuted the case along with fellow DA Phillip Stirling.",
        "79": "Anger said that the message sent by the jury's sentence - that killing a police officer and flaunting all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerated - was clear.",
        "80": "It was the constant support from Anger, Stirling and the District Attorney's office, from the Sheriff's Department and other law enforcement agencies, and from the family's large circle of friends that made the tumultuous trial more bearable, Chela and her in - laws insisted.",
        "81": "\"We could never repay them for all the support and love they have for this family, and that they have for Jerry, \" Chela said."

        "2": "Advanced Micro Devices announced Wednesday it is buying low - power server vendor SeaMicro, a surprise move that puts AMD in the systems business and disrupts Intel by acquiring one of its close partners.",
        "3": "AMD will pay US$334 million in cash and stock for SeaMicro, an 80 - employee Silicon Valley startup that has gained attention for building highly dense and power - efficient servers for use in large - scale cloud computing environments.",
        "4": "SeaMicro CEO Andrew Feldman will become general manager of a new division at AMD, the Data Center Server Solutions group.",
        "5": "AMD plans to sell SeaMicro - branded servers directly to customers, but it bought the company primarily for its technology, which it hopes to license to other server vendors to build their own low - power systems, AMD officials said.",
        "6": "\"SeaMicro has a proven technology that has been benchmarked in key customer sites to show improvements in power consumption and total cost of ownership.",

        "26": "The scale of SeaMicro's business today is much smaller than that of a Hewlett - Packard or a Dell, she said, and AMD thinks the value of SeaMicro's technology to server vendors will outweigh their competitive concerns.",

        "4": "Such products are particularly popular among companies that buy servers in huge volumes to run popular consumer websites.",
        "5": "AMD has long battled Intel in making chips for servers, as well as PCs, but it has struggled lately in the larger systems because of late products and other issues.",
        "6": "Both companies, meanwhile, face increasing competition from companies making lower - power chips that are based on architecture developed by ARM Holdings PLC.",
        "7": "Last year, Hewlett - Packard Co. announced a partnership with Calxeda Inc. , a start - up making ARM - based micro servers.",

        "2": "29th February 2012",
        "3": "AMD's new CEO Rory Read was fired up about executing better in the server racket at the company's analyst day earlier this month and has wasted little time in stirring things up with the acquisition of low - power server start - up SeaMicro for $334m.",
        "4": "SeaMicro is the server upstart founded four and a half years ago that came out of stealth in June 2010 with an Atom bomb: a 10U chassis crammed with 512 single - core Atom servers in a 10U chassis, all linked by a 1. 28Tb / sec 3D torus interconnect implemented on an ASIC that also virtualized all I / O in the cluster of server nodes and provided load balancing across those nodes.",
        "5": "Over time, SeaMicro has added 64 - bit Atoms, boosted the number of Atom processors and main memory in the system, and only a month ago announced a variant that used single - socket Xeon E3 - 1260L processors to give the SM10000 system some \"brawny cores\" to do heavier computational tasks.",
        "6": "The acquisition of SeaMicro will no doubt irk Intel, which has used SeaMicro as a poster child for its microserver and cloud computing efforts in the past two years.",
        "7": "So there's some public relations fun in that.",
        "8": "But there isn't much Intel can do about SeaMicro being in AMD's hands.",
        "9": "In a conference call with Wall Street analysts announcing the deal after the market closed, Andrew Feldman, SeaMicro's CEO and co - founder, said that his company had been buying Atom processors and chipsets from the distribution channel, not from Intel.",
        "10": "SeaMicro does not anticipate any changes in getting its supply of Atom and Xeon processors or building systems for current and future customers.",
        "11": "In the call, Read reiterated that AMD was \"seizing the inflection point\" in the server business.",
        "12": "The acquisition of SeaMicro, which along with Cisco Systems is one of the first new entrants in the server racket in years to actually look like it has a chance of making it, would \"accelerate out transformation into an agile and disruptive innovator. \"",
        "13": "As we can now see, looking at the past month in hindsight, is that AMD figured out that is needed to hunker down on its Opteron processor roadmaps and not force server makers to absorb a socket change in 2012, as was the original plan, but rather to get an improved \"Piledriver\" core for Opteron processors into the field this year and do lots of performance tuning to show what \"Bulldozer\" class of chip can really do.",
        "14": "The company then looked around and decided that it didn't need a new chip or chipset so much as a whole different set of technologies to sell to its server OEM partners.",
        "15": "That's where SeaMicro came in.",
        "16": "Much will be made of AMD entering the server business with the acquisition of SeaMicro.",
        "17": "But that's not the point, even if it will be technically true over the next months.",
        "18": "Lisa Su, senior vice president and general manager of the new Global Business Units at AMD, who is tasked with making sure the company has the components from which server makers want to build systems, put the kibosh on that idea.",
        "19": "\"This is a technology play for us, \" Su explained, calling the interconnect used at the heart of the SeaMicro system a \"unique technology\" that would be a \"building block\" that AMD integrates with its processors and chipsets and then in turn sells to server makers.",
        "20": "The company will work now to get AMD's Opteron server processors embedded in the SeaMicro machines, which it expected to have accomplished by the second half of this year.",
        "21": "The company will not divulge what Opteron chips it will weld onto the SeaMicro server boards, but it stands to reason that it would be a low - voltage Opteron 3200 or 4200 part.",
        "22": "In an interview with El Reg, Mark Papermaster, AMD's CTO, deflected all of the interesting questions about how the SeaMicro 3D torus interconnect might be used, such as extending it beyond one chassis to span multiple chassis under a single management and cluster domain, or maybe adding cache coherence and shared main memory across all or a portion of a SeaMicro server's nodes.",
        "23": "The acquisition, said Papermaster, \"allows us to redefine the server building block, \" and he noted that AMD was keen on becoming \"an agile SoC company, \" referring to system - on - chip designs that put processors and other system elements into a single piece of glass.",
        "24": "And he confirmed El Reg's sense that AMD was not getting into the server business.",
        "25": "\"You have that exactly right, \" said Papermaster.",
        "26": "When asked about when AMD and SeaMicro started talking, Papermaster would not be specific, except to say that AMD \"moved very, very rapidly. \"",
        "27": "This was quite possibly to keep someone else from buying SeaMicro and very certainly in part as a reaction to Intel's purchase of the InfiniBand networking business from QLogic back in January for $125m.",
        "28": "Papermaster would not comment on rumors that AMD has been taking a look at ARM server chip maker Calxeda, but it could very well turn out that if AMD had tried to do that deal, it might be grateful that it fell through.",
        "29": "The SeaMicro deal is a much better option if it wants to sell server interconnects and help OEM customers build cloudy servers and maybe even clustered supercomputers based on the SeaMicro \"Freedom\" fabric, as the latest generation is called.",
        "30": "That fabric is processor and instruction set agnostic, as Feldman has said many times, and SeaMicro only started out on Atom processors because they gave the best bang for the watt.",
        "31": "And it could turn out that Calxeda and AMD partner to make ARM servers somewhere down the road.",
        "32": "Why not?",
        "33": "Read wanted to make sure that everyone understood that the SeaMicro acquisition would have no effect on the company's 2012 and 2013 Opteron processor roadmaps and system plans, and that AMD was not leaving the traditional x86 server business.",
        "34": "\"We're in that business to stay, and we're going to grow it and invest in it, \" Read said.",
        "35": "AMD is paying $281m in cash and $53m in stock to acquire privately held SeaMicro, which raised $35m in two rounds of funding and also got $9. 3m in funding from the US government as part of the $787bn American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) of 2009.",

        "4": "Intel is developing integrated fabrics to boost I / O and high - performance networking and storage in servers, said Jason Waxman, general manager of Intel's data center business unit, in an interview.",

        "16": "It could take Intel years to develop technology that is competitive with SeaMicro's fabric, Brookwood said.",

        "2": "In a move that will subject a number of government projects to enhanced environmental and scientific scrutiny, President Obama is restoring a requirement that U. S. agencies consult with independent federal experts to determine whether their actions might harm threatened and endangered species.",
        "3": "The presidential memorandum issued yesterday, which marks yet another reversal of former president George W. Bush's environmental legacy, will revive a decades - old practice under the Endangered Species Act that calls for agencies to consult with either the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on whether their projects could affect imperiled species.",
        "4": "On Dec. 16, the Bush administration allowed agencies to waive such reviews if they decided, on their own, that the actions would not harm vulnerable plants and animals.",
        "5": "Obama, who visited the Interior Department to commemorate its 160th anniversary, said he had instructed Interior and Commerce Department officials to review the Bush rules.",

        "10": "Earthjustice lawyer Janette Brimmer, whose group had challenged the Bush rule in federal district court in California, said she expected that the new administration would reexamine two pending projects: a Bureau of Land Management plan for overseeing Oregon's forests, which was finalized on Dec. 30 and could affect protected species such as the northern spotted owl; and construction of the White Pine coal - fired power plant in Nevada.",
        "11": "\"I think the Obama administration now is going to take a step back on these projects.",

        "13": "Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an activist group, said the switch would help guard against the potential conflicts of interest and lack of expertise that could color decision - making by any agency hoping to press ahead with a particular project.",
        "14": "\"After years of scientific scandal, the Interior Department and its partner agencies need desperately to regain credibility by making decisions with honesty, clarity and transparency, \" Grifo said.",
        "15": "But William L. Kovacs, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce's vice president of environment, technology and regulatory affairs, said that reviving another layer of review \"will result in even greater delays to projects - - including stimulus - backed, job - creating projects - - as agencies now grapple with the prospect of lengthy interagency consultations to determine, for instance, if a bridge project in Florida contributes to the melting of Arctic ice.",
        "16": "This is such a departure from the spirit and the letter of the Endangered Species Act that we wonder if the law's drafters would even recognize it today. \"",
        "17": "The latest policy shift follows several other administration actions revamping environmental policies, including a reexamination of fuel economy standards and offshore oil drilling; a new review of whether to grant California and other states the right to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions from vehicles; and the endorsement of a new international treaty negotiation on global mercury emissions.",
        "18": "House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall II ( D - W. Va. ), who had been seeking to overturn Bush's endangered species rule through legislation, called the announcement \"one more indication that the new administration truly represents change for the better and is committed to the protection of our natural resources and our environment. \"",
        "19": "Officials said the move is unlikely to trigger broad use of the Endangered Species Act to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions.",
        "20": "While the Bush rule specifically prohibited endangered species consultations on the basis of \"global processes\" such as climate change, an Interior official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that under the new policy, such a review would be triggered only if scientific evidence suggested \"a causal connection\" between emissions from a federal project and its effect on an imperiled species or an identifiable part of its habitat."

        "2": "March 1, 2012 - - 07: 58 GMT ( 23: 58 PST )",
        "3": "At its recent financial analyst day, AMD indicated that intended to differentiate itself by creating products that were advantaged in niche markets, with specific mention, among other segments, of servers, and to generally shake up the trench warfare that has had it on the losing side of its lifelong battle with Intel ( my interpretation, not AMD management \u2019 s words ).",
        "4": "Today, at least for the server side of the business they made a move that can potentially offer them visibility and differentiation by acquiring innovative server startup SeaMicro.",
        "5": "SeaMicro has attracted our attention since its appearance ( blog post 1, blog post 2 ), with its innovative architecture that dramatically reduces power and improves density by sharing components like I / O adapters, disks and even BIOS over a proprietary fabric.",
        "6": "The irony here is that SeaMicro came to market with a tight alignment with Intel, who at one pint even introduced a special dual - core packaging of their Atom CPU to allow SeaMicro improve its density and power efficiency.",
        "7": "Most recently SeaMicro and Intel announced a new model which featured Xeon CPUs to address the more mainstream segments that were not a for SeaMicro \u2019 s original Atom - based offering.",
        "8": "So what does AMD hope to gain from this acquisition?",
        "9": "The strategic goal is a differentiated server architecture into which they can insert AMD silicon and IP.",
        "10": "The SeaMicro architecture shares many of the characteristics of the Calxeda / HP Redstone architecture, and can potentially allow AMD to produce reference architecture for its system partners to leverage that gives them significant density advantages over any conventional x86 server offering.",
        "11": "Since this architecture is initially targeted at dense computing environments such as those found in Web 2. 0, cloud service providers and similar workloads, as well as potentially at conventional HPC, the prospects for AMD are interesting.",
        "12": "Long - term success will hinge on several interlocking factors:",
        "13": "1. How much will AMD focus this offering on the ultra - dense space that SeaMicro started addressing versus trying to also take a bite out of the enterprise space?",
        "14": "2. How aggressively will they scale it?",
        "15": "The SeaMicro fabric does not extend beyond the single enclosure boundary, but that appears to be an implementation decision, not a fundamental architectural issue.",
        "16": "My personal belief is that fabric - based servers are the wave of the future, with SeaMicro Calxeda / HP serving as very significant guidelines for future development.",
        "17": "Scaling the fabric first for management and then for actual data traffic for shared I / O and eventually for coherent memory operations if needed is a natural progression.",
        "18": "3. What other IP will AMD add?",
        "19": "AMD has an interesting portfolio of GPU technology as well as CPU, and the incorporation of GPU technology could provide further differentiation in niche markets.",
        "20": "AMD has a choice of ways to monetize this IP, from selling systems based on its own processors ( possibly as early as late this year ) to providing reference designs and / or licensing the architecture or selling components like the fabric ASICs.",
        "21": "4. Will they also support ARM processors?",
        "22": "If AMD becomes the source of licensed IP for vendors wanting to chase HP in ultra - dense servers, they can also make money by licensing their technology and selling components for non - x86 architectures.",
        "23": "5. What will Intel do?",
        "24": "At least one of Intel \u2019 s partners, HP, already has a fabric - based dense server design that can support x86.",
        "25": "Will Intel develop a similar reference architecture in the hopes that their major systems partners will adopt it?",

        "36": "And so I understand people are a little nervous and a little scared about making change.",

        "5": "Tony was exhibiting his trademark awkward movement and Wladimir was measuring him with the left rangefinder.",
        "6": "It was a relatively even round without much action, but Klitschko landed the two best shots of the round even if Tony threw a little more.",
        "7": "Thompson tried jumping on Wladimir to start the second but the champion was prepared.",

        "1": "December 20, 2005",
        "2": "Vincent Gigante, who died yesterday in federal prison at 77, was the Genovese crime family boss who for three decades feigned lunacy to evade prosecution for crimes ranging from loan sharking to murder to bribing the entire police force of Old Tappan, N. J.",
        "3": "He was known as \"Chin, \" and his moniker was often invoked by denizens of the Mafia underworld with a hand - to - chin gesture rather than a word, the better to foil police bugs.",
        "4": "To the writers of headlines he was sometimes \"Daffy Don\" or \"the Oddfather\" for his habit of walking the streets of the West Village clad in a bathrobe, striped pyjamas, and slippers, while muttering incoherently.",
        "5": "Federal prosecutors claimed it was an act, but it was not until 2003, after more than three decades of faking mental illness, that Gigante admitted in court that he did it to avoid prosecution.",
        "6": "His admission came as part of a plea deal on behalf of his son, Andrew, also convicted of mob - related activities.",
        "7": "For two decades, Gigante was head of the Genovese crime family, which emerged as the largest of the five New York Mafia clans after decades of concerted federal prosecutions decimated its rivals.",
        "8": "It was estimated that there were some 300 members of the family under his control.",
        "9": "The Genovese rackets included guaranteeing labor peace to firms in construction, garbage removal, and trucking; extorting payoffs from companies doing business at the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth; various rackets at the Fulton Fish Market and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center; contracts for window - installation in city housing, and the old standbys of bookmaking, loan - sharking, and narcotics.",
        "10": "It was narcotics that first sent Gigante to prison, in 1959, when he received a five - year sentence after being caught conspiring to smuggle heroin from abroad.",
        "11": "Also sentenced in the case was the man who gave his name to the crime family, Vito Genovese.",
        "12": "Genovese ran his organization from behind bars while serving a 15 - year sentence.",
        "13": "It was a similar ruse - maintaining control of the family while incarcerated by transmitting orders through his son, Andrew - that was Gigante's downfall.",
        "14": "Gigante was born in the Bronx to parents who were immigrants from Naples, Italy.",
        "15": "His father was a jewelry engraver, and his mother was a seamstress.",

        "20": "In 1957 Gigante was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of Frank Costello, then the head of what would be called the Genovese family.",
        "21": "He was acquitted despite the testimony of a doorman who claimed to have witnessed the crime; Costello himself claimed not to have seen his assailant, despite being shot at close range from the front.",
        "22": "The shot had only \"creased his head, \" according to reports at the time.",
        "23": "The prosecutor in the Costello case claimed that Gigante was \"a young punk on the way up in the underworld who was chosen to kill Costello to win his spurs. \"",
        "24": "If so, it seemed to have worked, despite his having missed.",
        "25": "Costello retired soon after, and Genovese assumed control of the family, which had a history going back to Lucky Luciano.",
        "26": "After serving five years on the 1959 heroin conviction, Gigante resumed his life of crime.",
        "27": "He first sought psychiatric help in 1966, while under investigation for bribing New York City police.",
        "28": "In 1970, he was indicted for bribing the entire five - man police force of Old Tappan, N. J. , a small town in Bergen County where he had moved.",
        "29": "After he produced evidence that he was under psychiatric care at St. Vincent's hospital in Westchester, the court ruled that he was mentally incompetent to testify in the case.",
        "30": "It was a pattern Gigante would repeat in the coming decades, including committing himself several times when prosecutions threatened.",
        "31": "Gigante's immediate family supported him, especially Louis, the glad - handing, cigar - smoking priest and builder of low - income housing, who told reporters his brother had paranoid schizophrenia, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.",
        "32": "Federal marshals serving him with a subpoena at his mother's Sullivan Street apartment house once found him standing under the shower, fully clothed, holding an umbrella.",

        "35": "his mother told New York Post columnist Cindy Adams.",
        "36": "Gigante, meantime, was consolidating his power within the Genovese family.",
        "37": "In the late 1970s, he ran a crew in Lower Manhattan, operating waterfront rackets, as well as loan - sharking and gambling in New Jersey.",
        "38": "He emerged as head of the Genovese family by the early 1980s.",
        "39": "Federal prosecutors kept him under observation for decades, and Gigante kept up the crazy act with amazing consistency.",

        "41": "A sign hung on the wall warning business associates against loose talk: \"This place is bugged. \"",
        "42": "By the late 1980s, he rarely went to Old Tappan, preferring to spend his nights on the Upper East Side with his mistress, with whom he had three children.",
        "43": "Oddly, both his wife and his mistress were named Olympia.",
        "44": "Gigante's mental illness act allowed him to escape trial despite being indicted numerous times on charges ranging from bid rigging and extortion to conspiracy to commit eight murders.",
        "45": "His luck held until 1997, when a New York jury found him guilty of a range of charges and sentenced him to 12 years in the federal penitentiary.",
        "46": "It may have been a bad omen that the judge in the case, Jack B. Weinstein, insisted that Gigante wear a suit rather than a bathrobe to his trial.",
